# Recurrent Neural Network Workshop - MERCon 2023

Welcome to the "Recurrent Neural Network Workshop" repository for MERCon 2023! This repository contains materials and resources for the hands-on workshop focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for solving sequence-related problems.

## Workshop Overview

RNNs, short for Recurrent Neural Networks, are a fundamental class of deep learning models with the remarkable ability to handle sequential data. If you're curious about how RNNs can be used for understanding languages, predicting numbers over time, or even making creative art, this workshop is the perfect place to start your journey into the world of RNNs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following software/tools installed on your computer, or you can use an online platform like Google Colab:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - version 3.10.12
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - version 6.5.5
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - version 2.14.0

If you prefer, you can also use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), a free online platform for running Jupyter notebooks, to work through the workshop materials. Make sure to have Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Keras installed and updated to the specified versions on your local machine or use Google Colab as an alternative.


## Workshop Contents

- **Worksheets:** Explore the workshop content through the following Jupyter notebooks:

    - [RNN_worksheet1.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet1.ipynb): This notebook provides solutions and examples for tackling the "Reverse Sequence Problem" using Recurrent Neural Networks.

    - [RNN_worksheet2.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet2.ipynb): This notebook provides examples for tackling the "Reverse Sentence Problem" using Recurrent Neural Networks. Use the knowledge from [RNN_worksheet1.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet1.ipynb) to complete this worksheet and obtain the desired output.

- **Solutions:** If you need guidance or have questions, refer to the solution notebooks in the "solutions" folder:

    - [RNN_worksheet1_solution.ipynb](solutions/RNN_worksheet1_solution.ipynb): Solutions and explanations for [RNN_worksheet1.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet1.ipynb).
    
    - [RNN_worksheet2_solution.ipynb](solutions/RNN_worksheet2_solution.ipynb): Solutions and explanations for [RNN_worksheet2.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet2.ipynb).
