# Recurrent Neural Network Workshop - MERCon 2023

Welcome to the "Recurrent Neural Network Workshop" repository for MERCon 2023! This repository contains materials and resources for the hands-on workshop focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for solving sequence-related problems.

## Workshop Contents

- **Worksheets:** Explore the workshop content through the following Jupyter notebooks:

    - [RNN_worksheet1.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet1.ipynb): This notebook provides solutions and examples for tackling the "Reverse Sequence Problem" using Recurrent Neural Networks.

    - [RNN_worksheet2.ipynb](worksheet/RNN_worksheet2.ipynb): Delve into solutions and examples for the "Reverse Sentence Problem" using RNNs. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the "worksheet" folder to access the workshop materials and Jupyter notebooks.

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment and start learning and experimenting with RNNs for sequence-related tasks.
